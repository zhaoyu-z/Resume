iflytek:

Conducted research on the development of digital economy industry and optical fiber interception.
Using librosa, WebrtcVAD, Pytorch and UIS-RNN classification algorithms under Python, the speech extraction under the TIMIT corpus was completed, including basic speech noise reduction, framing, separation, classification, recognition, etc.
The model built was applied by the company on their investment decision.
Speech extraction accuracy: 98\%, Speech recognition accuracy: 97\% (Test set: Texas Instruments, MIT, SRI International TIMIT continuous speech corpus)

visa centre:

Coordinated more than 10 visitors from Babis-Bojay University for a week-long friendly exchange activity in Hubei Province
Completed bilingual translation of 6 visa and immigration documents (30 pages in total) and reports in both Chinese and English
Use Excel and PPT to participate in planning and organize the itinerary during their visit.
List the optional information of 30+ attractions and projects, and select the best plan which was adopted by leaders

personal website:

Tech stack: React, Typescript, Javascript, Html5, Css3 , Github Pages and Sass
Share my project achievements, daily lives, cooking photos and hobbies
Using a React framework, deployed on Next.js by Vercel. A summary of my lives and hobbies.
Currently under development, published on Github Pages, will eventually move to designated URL

optimizing minimal counterexamples:

Help users better understand bugs (Identify and locate errors) in java programs by reducing the numerical size of counterexamples generated by java BMC (Bounded Model Checker)
The feasibility of reducing the counterexample value was verified by using two java BMCs, JPF (Java PathFinder) and JBMC (Java Bounded Model Checker)
Configure and test various error types such as deadlock, race conditions, overflow, underflow in the gradle environment
All benchmarks in SV-COMP were checked by employing JBMC

question classifier:

A question classifier written in Python, which accepts a question and output one of N-predefined classes
Used Bag of Words (Bow) model, Bidirectional LSTM and its ensemble networks to implement
Test under random and pre-trained embeddings
Reached at accuracy 0.852 and F1-score 0.697

road tracking:

Without the use of GPS, by analyzing the satellite images returned by the drone, extracting location information surround it (match similar objects on the map to locate the camera) to establish the scope of the drone's activities.
Using Jupyter Notebook to implement OpenCV, Keras model and U-Net machine learning algorithm under Python to locate the drone
Accuracy is around 100 meters for well-trained models
